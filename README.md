CSDTAnimator
============

This is an educational software geared towards low-income, under-represented youth. The software is a Java Applet that can be run in a web browser or on a local machine. The program starts by simulating a cultural artifact, and through this, teaches students about the underlying mathematical and computing concepts used in the creation of that artifact. This is a cross-cultural simulation software.

To run this program, download the backbone library available at https://github.com/librod89/CSDTCore. Then download CSDTAnimator and reference Core as well as applet-launcher.jar, commons-codec-1.5.jar, Jama-1.0.2.jar, jbox2d.jar, jfugue-4.0.3.jar, and swing-layout-1.0.4.jar. Gluegen, Java3d, and jogl must also be downloaded.
